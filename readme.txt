Name: Air Hockey


Description: The most basic description of the game is two opponents trying to score a puck into the other’s goal. However, my implementation of the game will contain additional features to increase the difficulty of the game and make the game more complex, at the user’s discretion.

How to run the project: Run as normal (note: there is an image file that is included in the zipped file necessary to run the game)
